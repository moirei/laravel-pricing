# Concept

In large applications, pricing for provided goods or service are often not straight forward. For instance, you might want to charge $10 on an item for every 5 units purchased in AU, while at the same time, for your customers in US, regressively charge $50, $40, $30 for every quantity ranged between 0-30, 31-40, 50-infinity respectively.

This package has the concept of `standard`, `package`, `volume`, and `graduated` pricing intended to cover most (if not all) complex pricing scenarios. It also allows naming for multi-currency and multi-region use cases.
